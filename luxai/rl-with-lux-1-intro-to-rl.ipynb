If you haven't tried RL before, this tutorial is a perfect quick start into how RL generally works, and how to program a basic agent. This is part 1 of a 3 part series on training RL agents leading up to a succesful RL agent submittable to the Lux AI competition. Part 1 will cover the basics of RL, how gym environments work, and how to train an agent and scale up training.\n\nLet's dig in, welcome to the world of reinforcement learning!\n\nIn AI, RL is a framework of **learning via interaction**, often trying to **maximize the reinforcing reward**. Humans and animals alike sort of naturally follow the paradigm in learning behaviors. We reward a dog for doing a trick via a positive reward signal by giving it a treat. We penalize a dog for peeing on the floor by giving a negative reward signal (saying no!) or giving no reward. For a fun video of reinforcement learning you can watch this chicken below immediately learn to peck a particular colored dot via reinforcing it's actions with food.","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"code","source":"from IPython.display import IFrame\nIFrame(\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/spfpBrBjntg\", 640, 480,)","metadata":{"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2023-04-01T19:07:08.516658Z","iopub.execute_input":"2023-04-01T19:07:08.517148Z","iopub.status.idle":"2023-04-01T19:07:08.525416Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2023-04-01T19:07:08.517109Z","shell.execute_reply":"2023-04-01T19:07:08.524313Z"},"trusted":true},"execution_count":4,"outputs":[{"execution_count":4,"output_type":"execute_result","data":{"text/plain":"<IPython.lib.display.IFrame at 0x7f78787972d0>","text/html":"\n        <iframe\n            width=\"640\"\n            height=\"480\"\n            src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/spfpBrBjntg\"\n            frameborder=\"0\"\n            allowfullscreen\n            \n        ></iframe>\n        "},"metadata":{}}]},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"RL has seen a massive growth in applications in recent years thanks to the rise of deep learning resulting in Deep Reinforcement Learning.

It's what enables an agent in an environment to repeatedly interact and improve itself.\n\nWe discretize time in an environment into individual **time steps** labeled as `t` below. At each time step, the agent uses the current environment observation (also known as state) $S_t$ to produce an action $A_t$ and executes that action in the environment. The environment updates in response to the action and gives the agent a new observation $S_{t+1}$ as well as a reward signal $R_{t+1}$ telling the agent how well it is doing. Eventually the environment will tell the agent it is completed and this completes one full episode.\n\n![](https://github.com/Lux-AI-Challenge/Lux-Design-S2/blob/main/kits/rl/tutorials/assets/rl_loop.jpg?raw=1)\n\nThese days, in deep RL the agent is typically a deep neural network that takes an observation as input and produces an action as output.\n\nWhile the agent is continously interacting, it will also periodically update its neural network via an optimization algorithm with a few objectives. Training in RL requires balancing exploration and exploitation. While the overall goal of the agent is to exploit and to **maximize return** (the sum of rewards in an episode), you can easily learn suboptimal behaviors if you don't explore sufficiently in an environment to find better strategies. This explore vs exploitation problem is a foundational problem in RL that is still researched to this day.\n\nFor a deep dive into the math and algorithms the [Spinning Up project](https://spinningup.openai.com/en/latest/) provides a great tutorial on some of the modern deep RL algorithms.\n","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"### 1.1 Environment Loop Code\n\nLet's get programming!

Episode completion can occur for a number of reasons depending on the chosen environment. For CartPole-v0, `done` is `True` whenever a time limit is reached or if the pole falls down too far.

However it is very **sample inefficient**, meaning it needs many many environment interactions in order to learn something.

As vectorized environments accept a batch of actions, with GPUs/TPUs we can easily generate this batch of actions far faster than generating them one at a time, improving the speed at which we sample from an environment.\n\nTry changing the `n_envs` parameter below.
